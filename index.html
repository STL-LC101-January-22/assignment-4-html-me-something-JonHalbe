         <h2 >I was a daddy since I was a laddy</h2>
            <p class = "growing">I don't know why most people don't want to have children. Being a father is one of the 7 wonders of the world if you ask me. 
               I can understand that it's not for everyone but I grew up with 3 older sisters and 3 youngers brothers making me a parent by default 
               honestly. Since I had 3 younger brothers it was my duty to teach them right from wrong and how to behave. Never went over really well 
               with them so since like 13 I told myself that one day when I am a parent I will be the best dad I can. I moved out of my house and 
               got a job at 15 so basically i've been adulting for 10 years now and have been lucky enough to have Roman for the past soon to be 5 years.

         <h2>Being a father is never a bother</h2>
         <p id="father">One of the many reason I love being a dad is the fact that Roman inspires me to be better. Whenever I just wanna give up or not go into work
            I think about the money I won't put in his savings or about the things I won't be able to get for his birthday or Christmas. These may seem like
            arbitrary things but seeing him happy is what fuels my happiness. Every morning I get to be woken up by my favorite boy hopping on the bed and
            telling me either something he has drawn or is watching or playing with. As long as Roman is happy I am happy even when I don't feel like it. 
            He gives me some superhuman strength to always push forward and try to be the best version of myself I can be. I just wouldn't be the same man
            I am today without him influencing my life and way of thinking.

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Alright I ran out of ideas at this point. I hope you get the point though. If not I'll say it. Being a parent is one of lifes
               greatest tasks because you are responsible for their light in this world. Everything they intake and see influences who 
               they become and how they act. That's why I try to be as positive and understanding with Roman as I can. This has also led to 
               me being easier on myself as well. It has taught me to love unconditionally and always find an oppurtunity to teach
               no matter the circumstances. I honestly believe children can be the greatest teachers especially when it's a little you
               and you can see all the signs of how you behaved and acted as a child and that really makes you think. It also gives  you an oppurtunity
               to act better than your parents acted and just that small feat.
